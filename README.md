# autoencoders-tf

This tutorial introduces autoencoders with three examples: the basics, image denoising, and anomaly detection.

An autoencoder is a special type of neural network that is trained to copy its input to its output. For example, given an image of a handwritten digit, an autoencoder first encodes the image into a lower dimensional latent representation, then decodes the latent representation back to an image. An autoencoder learns to compress the data while minimizing the reconstruction error.
